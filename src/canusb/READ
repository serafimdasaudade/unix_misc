cceptance Register Calculations :
To compute the ACR and AMR registers of the SJA1000
CAN controller chip. This is important for filtering traffic.
You send these with the 'M' and 'm' messages to the CAN232. 
acramr_calc.c
acramr_calc_simple.c

I also found it useful to be able to tell what is filtered based on the ACR/AMR registers : 
acramr_rev_calc.c
